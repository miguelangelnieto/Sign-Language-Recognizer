# Sign Language Recognizer

Part of the [**Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Program.**](https://eu.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889)

Built a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL). Trained a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using part of a preprocessed dataset of tracked hand and nose positions extracted from video to try and identify individual words from test sequences. Experimented with model selection techniques including BIC, DIC, and K-fold Cross Validation.
